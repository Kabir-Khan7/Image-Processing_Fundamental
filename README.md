# 🧠 Image Processing Fundamentals with OpenCV

Welcome to **Image Processing Fundamentals**, a hands-on repository by **Kabir Khurshid** exploring the core building blocks of **computer vision and image processing** using **OpenCV** and **Python**.

This repository is designed for beginners and enthusiasts who want to **understand and visualize how images can be transformed, analyzed, and enhanced** using fundamental computer vision techniques.

## 📁 Repository Overview

Each topic folder contains:
- A **Python script** implementing the concept
- **Comments** explaining each key step
- Example **input/output images**

### Covered Concepts

| # | Topic | Concept Summary |
|---|--------|-----------------|
| 1️⃣ | **Color Spaces** | Learn how images are represented in different color models (BGR, RGB, HSV, Grayscale) and how color conversion helps in segmentation and analysis. |
| 2️⃣ | **Contours** | Detect and visualize object boundaries using contour detection; understand hierarchy and contour approximation. |
| 3️⃣ | **Edge Detection** | Explore image gradients and edges using techniques like Canny and Sobel filters to detect object outlines. |
| 4️⃣ | **Image Drawing** | Learn how to draw shapes (lines, rectangles, circles, text) on images for annotation or visualization. |
| 5️⃣ | **Image Resizing** | Understand interpolation methods (nearest, linear, cubic) and how resizing affects image quality and computation. |
| 6️⃣ | **Image Blurring** | Apply different types of smoothing filters (average, Gaussian, median) to reduce noise and enhance important structures. |
| 7️⃣ | **Thresholding** | Convert grayscale images into binary images using simple, adaptive, and Otsu’s thresholding for segmentation. |
